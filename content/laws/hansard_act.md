An Act to ensure the transparency and accountability of the Government and to create a clearer and more effective means of archiving the passage of laws.



## Article I
Should a Senator feel that a non-constitutional law passed by the Senate is no longer relevant, such as a treaty with a bygone nation, that Senator is permitted to request the President, within plain-view of the Senate, to nullify the law. Should the President approve the request, the law is made null and void, as if repealed.



## Article II
The Government shall see to it that a public archive of all passed laws is established, updated, and maintained in order to build and maintain a positive relationship between the citizenry and their Government. No law shall go into effect until it has been published to the public archive.



## Article III
The President may, with the advice of the Senate and the Secretary of Defense, declare a law as confidential, allowing the law to go into effect immediately without needing to be published. This ought to be reserved for special cases where the publication of the law could jeopardize the security and integrity of Icenia.



## Article IV
No law that defines criminal behavior or Amends the Constitution can be declared confidential. Nor shall any law be declared confidential on the basis of protecting Icenia, its Government, or its officials from reputational harm.



## Article V
The Government is expected to periodically reconsider each declaration of confidentiality. Should there be no prudent reason to maintain confidentiality, the President is expected to revoke the declaration forthwith and see that the law is published to the archive.



## Article VI
The President may, with the advice of the Speaker of the Senate, appoint (and likewise revoke) one or more Icenians as “Archivers” who are granted limited access to the Senate for the purpose of maintaining the public archive.

1. Archivers are permitted to make minor changes to laws to reflect their new status as laws, such as the changing of “A Bill to codify…” to “An Act that codifies…”, so long as they don’t change the meaning of the text.
2. Archivers are permitted to give laws shorter names, such as “Constitution of Icenia” as a shorter version of “The Constitution of the Third Republic of Icenia”, so long as they resemble and convey the same meaning as the true name.



## Article VII
A treaty is a Bill passed by the Senate which involves, wholly or in part, an agreement, arrangement, contract, etc with a foreign entity.

1. Any treaty passed by the Senate shall only be considered signed, ratified, and in effect when all other parties have likewise ratified the same treaty.
2. Any and all modifications to a treaty must be approved by the Senate unless made by a treaty-defined body with relevant powers.



## Article VII
Where dates are used for official purposes, such as recording Senate votes, the month must be spelt (not numbered), with shortened versions of the month permitted, eg: Aug instead of August. This would ensure clarity to all readers regardless of how the date is arranged.

1. Where a year is included, the full year must be used.
2. The sole exception to this article is the ISO 8601 standard date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
