All government officials have the right to access the Senate and its appropriate channels.

### *(a) The Senate*
The Senate shall be empowered to create, amend, repeal, and improve the law of Icenia, a power that cannot be transferred, only shared. Leading the Senate will be the Speaker of the Senate. Prior to each election, the President and Speaker of the Senate may, if both agree, alter the size of the Senate based on the active population of Icenia. Senators may be removed from their position via impeachment by a unanimous vote between the Speaker of the Senate, President, and Minister of Defense.

Senators may submit a proposal (hereby known as a “Bill”) to the Senate which triggers a voting period no shorter than 24 hours, ending thereafter at the discretion of the Speaker of the Senate, or when the Senate term ends. During that time, each Senator may vote to approve or reject the Bill, or abstain. Should the Bill receive majority approval (>50%) and receive Presidential Assent, it passes and, if applicable, becomes law. Bills that do not require Presidential Assent should be referred to as “Motions”. Bills and Motions that require supermajority approval (>=66.6%) or unanimous approval should be prefixed as “Enhanced” or “Unanimous” respectively.

**Speaker of the Senate:** The Speaker will be chosen from the pool of sitting Senators after each election via a Senate Bill. The Speaker may be impeached via an Enhanced Senate Motion. The Speaker shall be responsible for: leading the Senate; ensuring Senatorial procedure is followed; liaising between the Senate and the People, their President and Secretaries, and foreign entities.

### *(b) Secretary Positions*
The Secretary of Defense, the secretary of Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior will act as the administrative branch of Icenia and will be composed of Icenians holding the Patrician, Equestrian, or Consul titles.

**Secretary of Defense:** The Secretary of Defense will be appointed by the President and will serve until resignation or replacement. The Secretary shall be responsible for: military recruitment and training; coordinating the construction and maintenance of defensive infrastructure; leading defensive, offensive, and intelligence operations; and accumulating and maintaining munitions and military hardware.

**Secretary of the Interior:** The Secretary of the Interior will be appointed from amongst the citizenry via a Senate Motion and will serve for a two month term. The Secretary can be impeached by the President or an Enhanced Senate Motion. If the Senate impeaches the Secretary, the Senate must appoint a replacement within 48 hours. The Secretary shall be responsible for: approving new developments within the city; approving public works projects; decreeing zoning regulations; organizing public transport; maintaining and improving the factory room; constructing any new farms; and managing derelictions.

**Secretary of Treasury:** The Secretary of Treasury will be appointed by the President and will serve for a one month term. The Secretary can be impeached by the President or an Enhanced Senate Motion. The secretary shall be responsible for: maintaining a detailed list of expenses and income of the Icenian government; managing the assets of the Icenian government as they see fit; the ability to appoint a commerce committee to work in conjunction with him for managing economic stimulus in icenia; Prepare a monthly report for the senate indicating Icenian national resources.

### *(c) The President*
The President is the Head of State and the final check on the legislative, administrative, and judicial branches and shall serve until they are either impeached, resign, go inactive for three or more months, or dies in real life. If any of these happen, the Secretary of Defense will become President. The Senate can choose to impeach the President via a Unanimous Motion. The President shall be responsible for: assenting to or vetoing Senate Bills; appointing the Secretary of Defense; and decreeing national holidays.

### *(d) Elections*
Senate elections (aka “General Elections”) will begin at the start of each calendar month with a voting period no shorter than 24 hours, ending shortly thereafter at the discretion of the President. Should the election result in a tie, the President, with the advice of the Senate and the tied candidates, is empowered to decide how the tie will be resolved. Following the President’s certification of the final results, any subsequent appointments (Speaker of the Senate, Secretary of the Interior) should be held as soon as possible.

**Voting:** Each citizen may cast one ballot for each Senate position being filled; if the Senate is composed of five Senators, each citizen may vote for up to five different candidates. Citizens may not vote for the same candidate twice. The President will certify the election and will fill the Senate with the candidates who received the most votes.



## V. Judiciary System
The Judiciary shall exist as a means of redress of grievances. Each trial should conclude in a reasonable amount of time and be conducted in a fair and organized manner. The Icenian legal code should strive to be simple and direct; the spirit of the law should take precedence over the exact letter of the law.

The Magistrates’ Court shall handle most cases entering the judicial system. Each case shall be presided over and decided by an individual Magistrate assigned by the Speaker of the Senate from the Magistrates’ Bench. The Bench shall consist of at least four Icenians whose citizenship rank is “Citizen” or higher. Magistrates are appointed by a simple majority vote from the senate and serve for life, until resignation or dismissal by the senate. The chief magistrate is appointed by the senate from the members of the magistrates bench.

The Supreme Court however shall solely handle appeals from the Magistrates’ Court and from State courts, and any other special case with extenuating circumstances. Each case shall be presided over by a Senator assigned by the Speaker of the Senate, and decided by a Jury of all un-recused Senators.

### *(a) Pre-Trial Proceedings*
Players may request a redress of grievances in the #trial-requests Discord channel by stating as clearly as possible who they are suing and on what grounds. Should the plaintiff or defendant(s) be unable to access the Discord, such as by being banned, then they are permitted to find a legal representative who does have access to represent them.

The Chief Magistrate must then choose whether or not to permit the case to trial, a decision that must consider whether the plaintiff has standing and whether their allegations, if true, would rise to a claim which relief can be granted. If the trial is permitted, the Chief Magistrate must then decide whether the case should be assigned to the Magistrates’ Court or escalated to the Supreme Court. Both parties must be notified (with pings) if and when proceedings begin.

At the start of a trial, the Chief Magistrate must be diligent to assign an impartial Judge to oversee the proceedings and maintain order. Should either the defense or the plaintiff wish to do the trial via voice chat they must notify the Court so that arrangements can be made. If the Chief Magistrate is unable to assign an impartial Judge or ensure an impartial Jury, the President, with the advice of the Senate, the plaintiff, and the defense, is empowered to resolve the issue to ensure a fair trial.

### *(b) Trial Proceedings*
During the trial, all those involved (the defense, plaintiff, Judge, etc) are to refrain from discussing the trial in private or in public aside from the pertinent channels for said trial (the courtroom, #trial-deliberation, etc), until the trial has concluded.

Trial proceedings begin with an opening statement from the plaintiff which should give a more detailed account of their grievances as well as any accompanying evidence and witness testimony. The defense is then permitted to cross-examine and counter with a statement and any rebuttal evidence and witness testimony. The plaintiff may then do the same in return, rotating back and forth at the discretion of the Judge, with the defense entitled to the last word, until the plaintiff and defense are ready to proceed to closing statements. Finally, the plaintiff, then the defense will make closing statements which summarize their arguments and evidence and which request outcomes from the Court.

The Judge/Jury is then granted a maximum of 24 hours to deliberate, which should include considerations of aggravating and mitigating factors, after which the Judge must notify the parties involved of the result and any applicable sentences.

### *(c) Military Tribunal*
Prisoners captured in war or in military operations will be subject to a military tribunal. Icenians whose citizenship rank is “Citizen” or higher are exempt from military tribunals unless they were previously found guilty of treason. Prisoners subject to a military tribunal may be held until the end of the war or conflict or until the President, with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, chooses to release them (an example being a prisoner exchange). Once the conflict has ended, the Secretary of Defense, President, and Speaker of the Senate will deliberate, then vote on a sentence for each prisoner.

### *(d) Pearls*
Pearls of involuntarily held persons that are being kept in Icenia, were captured in Icenia, or were captured in a pursuit that began in Icenia (unless exempted by a relevant treaty) must be surrendered to the Government as soon as possible to be tried under Icenian law and, unless duly sentenced to pearl time, shall be released. The President however may, with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, extradite the pearl to a foreign entity.

### *(e) Justiciability*
The Courts should typically defer to the Chief magistrate’s decision to permit the case to trial if and when there are questions on the matter of justiciability.

Should any trial request regard internal State grievances, the Chief Magistrate should refer the case to that State’s respective judicial system. Only if the State refuses the case or the case is being appealed should the Chief Magistrate accept the case and assign it to the Magistrates’ Court or the Supreme Court respectively.

Icenian law and precedent may be used to prosecute crimes which occurred prior to Icenia’s occupation over where the crime occurred, only when those crimes can be argued were directly and intentionally harmful, and which Icenian law and precedent protected against prior to the crime’s occurrence.

5. The dereliction must be accepted by the Secretary of Interior.
6. The Secretary of Interior may state in their acceptance of the dereliction that the property will be transferred to the government, in which case the property shall be transferred to the government upon completion of the dereliction.
7. If the dereliction is not denied for 7 days, and accepted by the Secretary of Interior within 14 days, the dereliction is completed.
