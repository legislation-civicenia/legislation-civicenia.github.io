The following namelayer groups are considered the basic groups each Icenian Citizen

reinforcement group for doors, pressure plates, and buttons that all citizens may access.
2. **Icenia-Factories:** All public factories must be reinforced to this group. All doors, pressure plates,
and buttons leading into a public factory room must also be reinforced to
Icenia-Factories. **Residents may be granted access to Icenia-Factories.**
3. **Icenia-Nether1:** This group will contain all the doors, pressure plates, and buttons that lead into
the nether portal as well as areas in the nether itself. **Residents may be granted access to Icenia-Nether1.**
4. **Icenia-Farms:** Every farm in Icenia must be reinforced to Icenia-Farms. **Residents may be granted access to Icenia-Farms.**



## II. Infrastructure
The following groups will be used to reinforce various Icenian infrastructure such as rails
and roads.

1. **Icenia-Roads:** All roads in the city of Icenia must be reinforced to Icenia-Roads.
2. **Icenia-Rail:** All rails built by Icenia must be reinforced to this group. Additionally, any
structures associated with the rails will also be reinforced to Icenia-Rail
3. **Icenia-Infra:** Any other infrastructure not applicable to the two groups above should be
reinforced to Icenia-Infra. Some examples include parks, public buildings, and
walls.

The following namelayer groups pertain to the defense of Icenia. The Minister of

reinforced to this group.
2. **Icenia-City-Snitches:** This group will host all of the jukebox snitches in Icenia City.
3. **Icenia-Defense:** All Icenian militia members must be in this group. It will serve as the first level of
